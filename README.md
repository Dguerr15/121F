# Devlog Entry - 11/14

## Introducing the Team
Tools Lead - Nick,Nate

Engine Lead - Norman, Josh

Design Lead - David

Everybody will have input into all parts these are just the people facilitating the conversations.

## Tools and materials
1. Our team will start with Phaser. We chose Phaser mainly because of its deep documentation online with extensive examples. Secondly, we chose Phaser because of its ease of access. It is very easy to start on a Phaser project since its systems are simple for the most part. And, finally, we went with Phaser because of our previous experience with it in CMPM 120, the prerequisite to this course. Since we are all pretty experienced with Phaser rather than Unity or another engine, we believed this would be quick to start with and get our game up and running as efficiently as possible.

2. Since we are using Phaser as our main engine to start, we are going to be using the JavaScript language and the JSON data language. We chose these because we did lots of projects in CMPM 120 using these languages. We felt that we had a somewhat solid background in these languages, so this seemed like an obvious choice.

3. Visual Studio Code will be our team's main IDE. Since we all have been using this IDE for a while, it made sense to stick with it to be efficient for the project. For the visual assets of our game, we will be using GIMP and Tiled. This should hopefully make our workflow of art simple as well, but we chose GIMP and Tiled because it's something our team is excited to learn more about.

4. Since we are using Phaser, our alternate platform will be Excalibur.js. We thought it would be smart to use an engine that has some similarities to Phaser as it will cause less headaches and stress as we carry our code forward and implement new ideas. We also wanted to keep the submission deadline in mind and remember that at the end of everything, we will have to submit something that works, so using Excalibur.js was our choice. However, this engine uses TypeScript as its main language, so we will probably have to switch our code around for that which shouldn't be too difficult.

## Outlook
- Our team is looking to add more interactive and fun game mechanics such as a weather system or maybe a combat system where enemies try to steal your crops and so on. We think this can add another interesting element to that game we will make that other teams might not try.
- We anticipate that switching platforms and languages will be the hardest and riskiest part of the project. Since none of us have used Excalibur.js before, this could be a tough obstacle to move past. We also have to make sure we finish our project on time to submit it, so we will have to figure out effective workflows when switching our engine/library.
- We are hoping to learn GIMP and Tiled for asset creation for our game and also the best way to refactor and change our code which will make it a lot easier if we have to switch engines or platforms. This can be beneficial for us in the future as well since we will always be working with different technologies in our careers, so being able to adapt is another key element we want to learn.
