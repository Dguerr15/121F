# DevLog Entry - 11/14

## Introducing the Team
Tools Lead - Nick, Nate

Engine Lead - Norman, Josh

Design Lead - David

Everybody will have input into all parts these are just the people facilitating the conversations.

## Tools and materials
With about one paragraph each...

Tell us about what engines, libraries, frameworks, and or platforms you intend to use, and give us a tiny bit of detail about why your team chose those.
    -Start with phaser, because we all did it in cmpm 120 and it satisfies our needs completely.  
Tell us programming languages (e.g. TypeScript) and data languages (e.g. JSON) you team expects to use and why you chose them. Presumably you’ll just be using the languages expected by your previously chosen engine/platform.
    -Start with typescript then move to javascript. For data language we will be using JSON.
Tell us about which tools you expect to use in the process of authoring your project. You might name the IDE for writing code, the image editor for creating visual assets, or the 3D editor you will use for building your scene. Again, briefly tell us why you made these choices. Maybe one of your teammates feels especially skilled in that tool or it represents something you all want to learn about.
    -We expect to use VS code and github for version control
Tell us about your alternate platform choice. Remember, your alternate platform must differ from your primary platform by either changing the primary primarily language used or the engine/library/framework used for building your user interface.
    - We will be switching our engine from phaser to .............

## Outlook
Give us a short section on your outlook on the project. You might cover one or more of these topics:

What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?
    - Our team is looking to push the boundaries of player agency in a farming game by incorporating a unique seasonal mechanic that adapts over time and affects the reap-and-sow cycle in meaningful ways. Rather than simply having static cycles, we aim to introduce dynamic environmental factors—like unpredictable weather patterns, soil quality changes, and pest invasions—that evolve and require the player to adapt their strategy in real time. This approach brings a deeper level of engagement to farming games, creating a more immersive and challenging experience as players react to a constantly changing environment, making our project truly stand out.
What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?
    - Swithcing engines and everything still working properly within a managable time frame.
What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?
    - How to properly refactor code so in the future engine changes are much easier to come by.
